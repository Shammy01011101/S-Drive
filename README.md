# S-Drive by Shammy
S-Drive hosts my collection of useful tools required in the tech industry. These tools have proven useful in both remote and onsite work. 
To create an S-Drive, download and run the 'Update S-Drive' script and point it to a USB drive. NOTE: Everything on the USB drive will be erased.
Alternatively, you can just download any tool that you require from above as needed.

## The story behind S-Drive
Over the years working in the tech industry, I have accumulated a collection of tools for diagnosing software and hardware problems. My colleagues frequently asked to use these tools, which inspired me to replicate my toolkit and make it available to them.

Initially, my tools were stored on a spare USB drive. To avoid issues with outdated or compromised tools due to multiple users, I devised a solution to replicate the toolkit efficiently.

This led to the creation of the S-Drive (Shamrock's Drive). I set up an area on my personal server to host the original contents and developed a Batch script that could run on certain networks. This script checks the integrity of the files and overwrites any discrepancies, such as corrupted, additional, or missing files.

This system allowed me to replicate the S-Drive multiple times, resulting in about 12 copies that everyone could use. A key feature was the ability to wipe and clean the S-Drive after use on a compromised PC.

For updates, I simply updated the host server, and the changes would propagate to each S-Drive when the script was activated.

I still use the S-Drive today. With the shift to more remote support, I created a cloud version of the S-Drive. By navigating to s-drive.shamrockcossar.com, I can access and download any tools via the internet. It has since seen migrated away from my home server onto Github with the update scripts updated, this gives me better performance and speed
